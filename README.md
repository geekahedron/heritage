# NeverEnding Heritage

Heritage is a customizable modpack for the online game NeverEnding Legacy (http://orteil.dashnet.org/legacy/).

It features a new GUI tab with toggle-able options for the different gameplay elements of the game, so you can pick and choose which of the various tweaks you want to use in your game!

## Installation

Start a new game of Legacy and click the "Use mods" button, adding the latest version of the main script file one a new line (leave data.js in place).
The current public version is mirrored at: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/geekahedron/heritage@b56c8f22e288bc3c4725741a17cca237e0df6fe3/heritage.js

You only have to include this once, and the manifest will update automatically to provide ew, stable (and backwards-compatible) versions as they are released.

## Usage

After loading the mod, nothing in the game will be immediately changed, but you will see a new "Heritage" tab at the top of the screen.
This tab will have toggle buttons for the different components of the mod, each of which unlock new and exciting modes and technologies for your game.
